# Homework-Employee-Tracker
Command line app using Node and mySQL to manage a database of employee and department info

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role

  
- **What was your motivation?**
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
  
- **Why did you build this project?**
We built this project because developers frequently have to create CMS interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. We also built this command-line application from scratch to practice using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

This allows a user to manage a company's employee database.

I learned how to create and connect a DB to a CLI app.

- **What challenges did you encounter?**
Starting mySQL and permissions.
